      "description": "By early 2020 I'd spent years working at and running some of the best restaurants and bars in Seattle, and while parts of me loved the F&B industry I knew I wanted a change but wasn't sure how to transition my career. Suddenly in March of that year every bar and restaurant closed it's doors and I had all the free time in the world to sit and think about exactly what I wanted.\n While trying to work out what my big move would be I remembered a conversation I had had with a regular when I was tending bar. I mentioned that I was in awe of the things he did but I could never do them, my brain just didn't work like that. He told me I was wrong, my brain could work like that if I wanted it to, I just had to put in the time and have enough grit to keep trying. So I put him to the test and took a coding class online. I found that after just a few classes that I was obsessing over my code, and that every time I was able to write a functional algorithm I would get a little jolt of adrenaline and excitement. The more I studied, the more I got interested in the nitty gritty of how things worked and I kept finding myself going down these endless rabbit holes which was overwhelming but also empowering, and somewhere down in one of those rabbit holes, after I wrote my first few functional applications, I knew that this was what I wanted to do, and I went all in. In early 2021 I enrolled in an accelerated software development program at Code Fellows, and in September of 2021 I graduated with a countless new tools, frameworks, and languages I can now use to build the kinds of applications I only used to dream about.",
